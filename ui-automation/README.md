## Example
Here, I have developed sample test cases for a sample web site [Demoblaze](https://demoblaze.com/).

This project is developed to demonstrate Web UI automation using Robot Framework and Selenium Library.

Here, there are 3 variables `${SMALL_RETRY_SCALE}`, `${MEDIUM_RETRY_SCALE}` and `${LARGE_RETRY_SCALE}` for retrying the keywords when they are failing. Each variable has assigned with the number of retries. Automation engineers are advised to use `${SMALL_RETRY_SCALE}` as the default number of retries for the keywords. If there are big delays in some scenarios, you can use other variables `${MEDIUM_RETRY_SCALE}` and `${LARGE_RETRY_SCALE}`. You can find the examples for this in `object-repository/page-objects` directory.

Test cases are in `test-cases` directory and covers login functionality.

## Usage
Starting from Robot Framework 3.0, tests are executed from the command line
using the ``robot`` script or by executing the ``robot`` module directly
like ``python -m robot`` or ``jython -m robot``.

The basic usage is giving a path to a test (or task) file or directory as an
argument with possible command line options before the path

 path/to/ui-automation>   python3 -m robot -v ENV:DEMO -i Smoke -d path/to/results path/to/tests/
 path/to/ui-automation>   python3 -m robot -v ENV:DEMO -i Smoke -d /results /test-cases/LoginTest.robot

"***-v***" refers to the variables. To replace a declared value within the code, you can specify a variable name and value.

"***-i***" refers to the tags. To run only a selected group of tests, you may specify a tag name.

"***-d***" refers to the test results. The location to save the test results can be specified here.

Additionally, there is ``rebot`` tool for combining results and otherwise
post-processing outputs

    rebot --name Example output1.xml output2.xml

Run ``robot --help`` and ``rebot --help`` for more information about the command
line usage. For a complete reference manual see [Robot Framework User Guide](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html "Robot Framework User Guide").
