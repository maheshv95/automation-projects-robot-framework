## Robot Framework Introduction
[Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org) is a generic open source
automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test driven
development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It has simple plain
text syntax and it can be extended easily with libraries implemented using
Python or Java.

Robot Framework is operating system and application independent. The core
framework is implemented using [Python](http://python.org), supports both
Python 2 and Python 3, and runs also on [Jython](http://jython.org) (JVM),
[IronPython](http://ironpython.net) (.NET) and [PyPy](http://pypy.org).
The framework has a rich ecosystem around it consisting of various generic
libraries and tools that are developed as separate projects. For more
information about Robot Framework and the ecosystem, see
